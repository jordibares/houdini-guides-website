The goal of this collective book is to help accelerate the adoption of Houdini as the main tool in VFX by simplifying the transition from other tools to Houdini.

## A bit of history

During 2008 Autodesk bought their arch-rivals, Softimage and included in their already crowded product line, all of us Softimage users started to notice massive changes during that period tailing off in the product development which ultimately ended up in Autodesk killing Softimage product 2014 and our lives were forced to transition to other products.

I saw the writing on the all the moment Autodesk bought Softiamge so I did transition first and all my learnings became invaluable once Autodesk killed Softimage which prompt me to write a free book called "Houdini to Softimage transition guides" that was distributed freely thanks to the nice folks at Side Effects.

## Today

But of course, Houdini is moving very very fast indeed and these guides are a bit obsolete, the task is huge so I am thinking on starting a crowd sourced re-write to fill update from scratch the whole thing.
