# Screen Recording

{{< preamble >}}
As much as the written word is king, there are times it may be very convenient produce a little video to showcase an operation.
{{< /preamble >}}

In these cases we may want to record our screen and produce an animated GIF that can be embedded in the article and showcase complex steps in this manner. This is particularly interesting when you deal with setting nodes and its parameters, may be adding expressions, etc...

The recomendation is to utilise a tool like [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/?ref=hackdesign%3fref=hackdesign) which is free or alternatively go for something nicre like [Gifox](https://gifox.io) which what I use.
