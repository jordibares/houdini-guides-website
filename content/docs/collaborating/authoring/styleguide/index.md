# Style Guide

Reading online is very different from reading on printed form, for this reason it is very important to be brief, direct and write in a non-condescending tone, building using our base structure is also very important, for this reason here you have some pointers on how to deal with it.

## Voice

Use your voice

## Tone

The tone

## Struture of a page

A page is structure as follows;

1. Header
2. Intro
3. Section(s)
	* Dig into various levels but try to keep it clear.
	* Mix images carefully to build a mental map of the article as well as to document features.
	* Use quotes as a way to help building a global view of the article.
4. Recap/Conclusions


## Recommendations

It is important we are respectful of other people's work, for this reason please;

	- Use "quotes" to highlight what you want the reader to remember.
	- Use hyperlinks when possible, give credits when possible.
