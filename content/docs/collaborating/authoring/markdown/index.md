# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats which is the crucial part for efficient authoring of content.

So, after many months testing and deciding I settled with a static web generator that utilises [Black Friday markdown](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/archive/content-organisation/blackfriday-markdown/) for all the writting.

<br/>

## Writting process

The general idea is that you create a new post and write your text, include images and what not. This is later processed on publishing to generate pure HTML with some CSS and JS to bring some magic to the content.

No databases, no special tokens nor plugings for easy authoring... fun right?
