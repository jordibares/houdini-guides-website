# Authoring

{{< preamble >}}
The information architecture, writting standards and technical infrastructure required forces us to have a bit of a protocol in place so we can produce as if it was the hand of one single person.
{{< /preamble >}}

## Configuring your machine

First of all, in order to collaborate you are going to need a few tools, most notably Git, Git-LFS and Hugo but also some infrastructure tools for your computer like Brew.

## Authoring workflow

The general workflow is to keep updating [git repository](https://github.com/jordibares/houdini-guides-website) stored at [github](https://github.com) using the fork/pull mechanism.

This means that you fork the repository, write all you want, modify all you want and then do a pull request so your updates can be monitored and incorporated on the main repository.

## Writting with markdown instead of html

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io), the underlying static website cretoion technology utilised in by Houdini Guides relies on BlackFriday markdown processor so it is important you get familiar with it by reading [Peter's blog markdown reference](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/archive/content-organisation/blackfriday-markdown/)

## Writting style guide

How we speak is critical to communicate effectively, therefore we are going to revisit how to write by approaching the [voice, tone and style](https://gathercontent.com/blog/voice-tone-style-whys-wheres-hows), hopefully we can produce a coherent book that everyone can enjoy.

## Screen Recording standards

Given the space requirements for videos, the suggested approach is to upload them to your [Vimeo](https://www.vimeo.com) account and link your article videos to those. I don't want to impose extra burden on you so I will offer to host those videos on my own account later on and will ask you to send me the master video and I will take care of the rest.
