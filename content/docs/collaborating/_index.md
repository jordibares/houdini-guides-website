There are many ways to collaborate, make sure you understand what form of commitment you want to embark first.

We will need people helping us creating and reviewing content, creating snapshots, video recordings and graphics. All of it will need you to use certain tools and procedures which will be very helpful in your future projects, so don't shy away, it is going to be fun.
