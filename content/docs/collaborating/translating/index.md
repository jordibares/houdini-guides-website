# Translating

Ideally we want to have all content translated to other languages, for this reason we are keen in having native speakers that can give us a hand.

If you fancy the idea of helping us translate to these languages;

- Spanish
- French
- German

Please [Contact us]({{< ref "/docs/about/_index.md" >}}) to us and we can help you setup your account.
