# About

The intention is to create the kind of guides we users want to pass to our friends coming to Houdini, a guide the allows them to get a quick global view of the software and a good understanding of the phylosophy and common practices.

For this reason a bunch of us are putting some of our spare time to build these docs, these are the main culprits.

## Team

### Jordi Bares

The original author of the guides and main driving force of this particular effort, if something goes wrong, it is his fault.
