# Houdini Guides Book

{{< preamble >}}
A re-invention of the orginal "Softimage to Houdini Transition Guides" as an open source effort.
{{< /preamble >}}

This book is structured as a guides to transition rather than a reference, and in particular, it is architected as a linear journey to move quickly throught the various areas to get a good global view of the software an translate those years of experience coming form Maya, Cinema4D or others as fast as possible.

Some chapters will be very dense and further re-organisation will be required so please keep in mind, your bookmarks may easily be broken for most part of the first year.
