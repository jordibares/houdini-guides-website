# Part 1

Before we start with the details, it is important to build a foundation of key concepts and procedures so you understand how Houdini operates.

## Introduction

In this section we are going to lay the foundations of the user interface, houdini phylosphy, how scenes should be organised, we are going to talk about the camera, color management and also the syntax of the various languages at your disposal.

## Modelling

Many may think Houdini is not a modeller but I can assure you is not bad at all, specially when combined with procedural modelling which gives a total new dimension that will probably justify the inconvenience of the more traditional tools being different from other packages.

## Texturing

Here we will talk about texture projections, UV, procedual UV generation and various techniques to extract the most value of Houdini.

## Shading

And finally, we will be talkign about materials and shaders focusing exclusively on the new MAT context.
