# General Concepts

Before we start with the details, it is important to build a foundation of key concepts and procedures so you understand how Houdini operates.

## UI interface layout

Like every other 3D software package, the interface and user experience you live every single day can make or break the moment, for this reason I rather outline the basics first so you know where things are, which will lead neatly onto the underlying Houdini phylosophy.


## Houdini phylosophy

Houdini is not that different yet, it is another beast altogether if you don't get some fundamentals right, the same fundamentals that other packages hide from you, those are right. front and center in Houdini so we better get that right.


## Scene organisation

Once you get the phylosophy it should be easy to explore methods to organise your scene and your assets. Also, various conventions Houdini arists use that you will learn to love and that will speed up the adoption.


## Camera

And of course, a special mention should go to how a camera works in Houdini in respect to Maya, Max, Modo or Cinema 4D.


## Color Management

Furthermore, it is critical you set your color management right, for this reason we will also visit this section in particular as a reference explaining the various correct approaches and how to manipulate your textures to get the most of your render engine.


## Syntax

And last but not least, Houdini animals have their on syntax, meaning; when you use expressions, or the Vex language or attributes, these require you to know certain things. Let's explore the basics here so we can move fast later.
